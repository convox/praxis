# Convox Praxis

A framework for modern application infrastructure.

## QUICKSTART

[Getting Started with Convox Praxis](https://github.com/convox/praxis/blob/master/docs/getting-started-local.md)

## ABOUT

Praxis allows you to specify the entire infrastructure for your application using simple primitives.

```yaml
caches:
  sessions:
    expire: 1d
keys:
  master:
    roll: 30d
queues:
  mail:
    timeout: 1m
services:
  web:
    build: .
    port: 3000
    scale: 2-10
timers:
  cleanup:
    schedule: 0 3 * * *
    command: bin/cleanup
    service: web
```

### API

Praxis makes these primitives available to your application with a simple API.

```
# list applications
GET /apps

# put an item on a queue
POST /apps/myapp/queues/mail

# get an item from a queue
GET /apps/myapp/queues/mail

# encrypt some data
POST /apps/myapp/keys/master/encrypt
```

### Rack

A Rack is the substrate for running Praxis applications and exposes the Praxis API both externally to
management tools and operators and internally to the applications themselves.

Praxis Racks are currently available for the following environments:

#### Local

Runs on your laptop (or any single node). Great for development and CI.

#### AWS

A fault-tolerant, highly scalable architecture built on modern AWS services such as ECS, ALB, and Lambda.

## INSTALLATION

### CLI

#### MacOS

    $ curl https://s3.amazonaws.com/praxis-releases/cli/darwin/cx -o /usr/local/bin/cx
    $ chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cx

#### Linux

    $ curl https://s3.amazonaws.com/praxis-releases/cli/linux/cx -o /usr/local/bin/cx
    $ chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cx

### Rack

#### Local

    $ sudo cx rack install local

##### Local Rack installation requires `sudo` to resolve and route local hostnames such as `myapp-web.convox`

#### AWS

    $ cx rack install aws

## DEPLOY

#### Create a convox.yml

[TODO: Reference Docs]()

See the `convox.yml` and the [`examples/`](https://github.com/convox/praxis/tree/master/examples) subdirectory of this project.

#### Create an application

    $ cx apps create myapp

#### Set environment variables

    $ cx env set FOO=bar

#### Deploy the application

    $ cx deploy

## UPDATING

Your local CLI will automatically keep itself up to date.

You can update an installed Rack using `cx rack update`.
