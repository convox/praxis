# Getting Started With Convox Praxis

Convox Praxis is a universal infrastructure interface. When you develop and deploy applications using Praxis you completely abstract away concerns about where your application is running. In minutes you can set up a system that has perfect development / production parity and deploy your app to the cloud.

This guide will walk you through installing the Praxis CLI, the Rack deployment platform, and deploying an application.

## Setting up your development platform

### Install the CLI

First, install the `cx` command line client.

#### MacOS

    $ curl https://s3.amazonaws.com/praxis-releases/cli/darwin/cx -o /usr/local/bin/cx
    $ chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cx

#### Linux

    $ curl https://s3.amazonaws.com/praxis-releases/cli/linux/cx -o /usr/local/bin/cx
    $ chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cx

Confirm that cx is correctly installed:

    $ which cx
    /usr/local/bin/cx

### Install the development platform

Your applications will run on a private platform called a *Rack*. While your production Rack will likely run on a cloud infrastructure provider like AWS, you can also install a Rack on your development computer. This makes it easy to achieve dev/prod parity.

To install a local Rack you'll first need to install Docker. The free Docker Community Edition can be found for your OS [here](https://www.docker.com/community-edition).

Once you have Docker up and running you can use `cx` to install a local Rack:

    $ sudo cx rack install local
    installing: /Library/LaunchDaemons/convox.frontend.plist
    installing: /Library/LaunchDaemons/convox.rack.plist

This will install a Rack onto your local machine.

### Clone the example app

We'll use the Praxis documentation site to demonstrate deployment. It's a Go app using the Hugo project for static websites.

Clone the app and enter its directory:

    $ git clone https://github.com/convox/praxis-site.git
    $ cd praxis-site/

#### convox.yml

The first thing to take note of in the project is the `convox.yml` file. This is where the app's description and configuration live.

```yaml
services:
  web:
    certificate: ${HOST}
    port: http:1313
    scale: 2
    test: make test
```

The `convox.yml` for this site is pretty straightfoward. It defines a single service called `web`.

Nested under `web` is a `certificte` config. An SSL certificate will be automatically configured for the domain specified by the app's `HOST` environment variable. `HOST` is automatically set and can be overridden for a custom domain.

The `port` configuration means containers for the web service will listen on port 1313 for http requests.

Two copies of the container will be run, according to the `scale` setting.

The app's default test command is `make test` as configured by `test`. This will be used later in the guide.

The `convox.yml` you cloned also has a `workflows` section. You can ignore that for the purposes of this guide.

### Deploy the app

Now that you've seen what a Praxis app looks like, you can deploy it to your local Rack.

First you'll need to create an app in your Rack to use as a deployment target:

    $ cx apps create praxis-site

You should now see it in your apps list:

    $ cx apps
    NAME         STATUS
    praxis-site  running

Now deploy:

    $ cx deploy
    building: /Users/matthew/code/convox/praxis-site
    uploading: OK
    starting build: eed730a1180227074e774357acf8201cd39fe8f7478c367374ced3ded78cb92e

    saving cache
    storing artifacts
    starting: convox.praxis-site.endpoint.web
    starting: convox.praxis-site.service.web.1

The application is now deployed to your local Rack. You can find its endpoints with the CLI:

    $ cx services
    NAME  ENDPOINT
    web   https://web.praxis-site.convox

You can visit [https://web.praxis-site.convox](https://web.praxis-site.convox) to view it.

### Edit the source

Now that you have the app up and running, you can try the development cycle by making a change to the source code and deploying it to your development rack.

Open `content/index.md` in the project and add the text "Hello, this is a change!" right below the Introduction header. After the edit your file should look like this:

    ---
    title: Introduction
    weight: 5
    ---
    
    # Introduction
    
    Hello, this is a change!

    $ cx deploy

Reload the site in your browser and verify that the Introduction text has changed.

### Run tests

You can test an app using `cx test`. This command will create a temporary application container, deploy the current code to it, and sequentially run the `test:` command specified for each service. If a `test:` command is not specified, no tests will be run. `cx test` will abort and pass through any non-zero exit code returned by a test command.

    $ cx test

    web     | test -f static/images/logo.png

If you'd like to see the test fail, just delete `static/images/logo.png` and run `cx test` again.

### Building without Deploying

While `cx deploy` is an easy way to deploy changes to a Rack, the various steps are available at the CLI so that you can customize your workflow.

This time, let's create a build but not deploy it:

    $ cx build
    uploading: .
    starting build: 16dd308f6b61e40b768d60eb8238b758dee8e9a3848d2330b0ca9bd26a817031
    preparing source
    restoring cache
    building: .
    running: docker build -t 9836064b94124bad54f83c70026dd85fcb8b5a13 /tmp/124604449
    Sending build context to Docker daemon 19.56 MB
    Step 1/2 : FROM convox/hugo:0.0.1
     ---> 95f8d1e0347e
    Step 2/2 : COPY . /app
     ---> 5c9e32a1e857
    Removing intermediate container 8bebd36bc5a9
    Successfully built 5c9e32a1e857
    running: docker tag 9836064b94124bad54f83c70026dd85fcb8b5a13 convox/praxis-site/web:BHRATEYFZS
    saving cache
    storing artifacts

Building without deploying is useful to stage changes and then deploy them as a unit.

### View releases

Every time you build your app (or change an environment variable) a new "release" is created to keep up with these changes. You can list these releases:

    $ cx releases
    ID          BUILD       STATUS    CREATED
    RTKJFWMKYG  BHRATEYFZS  created   4 minutes ago
    RYCQLGAAAV  BJKETOESCA  promoted  19 minutes ago

You can see from this list that the most recent release, `RTKJFWMKYG`, was created but not promoted which means its changes have not yet been deployed.

### Set an environment variable

A new release is also created when you change the application's environment.

    $ cx env set FOO=bar
    updating environment: OK

### Diff releases

Before you promote a release, you can use `cx diff` to summarize the changes about to be deployed:

    fetching RTKJFWMKYG: OK
    fetching RYCQLGAAAV: OK
    diff --git a/var/folders/cy/f_d_fkvn4jxckgbrxlxp4xpc0000gn/T/718088251/content/index.md b/var/folders/cy/f_d_fkvn4jxckgbrxlxp4xpc0000gn/T/004534604/content/index.md
    index 0dbdcc5..a93138a 100644
    --- a/var/folders/cy/f_d_fkvn4jxckgbrxlxp4xpc0000gn/T/718088251/content/index.md
    +++ b/var/folders/cy/f_d_fkvn4jxckgbrxlxp4xpc0000gn/T/004534604/content/index.md
    @@ -5,6 +5,8 @@ weight: 5
    
     # Introduction
    
    +Hello, this is a change!
    +

Once you verify the diff you can promote it.

### Promote a release

    $ cx promote
    promoting RTKJFWMKYG: OK
    starting: convox.praxis-site.endpoint.web (https://web.praxis-site.convox:443)
    starting: convox.praxis-site.service.web.1

The release will now show as promoted.

    $ cx releases
    ID          BUILD       STATUS    CREATED
    RTKJFWMKYG  BHRATEYFZS  promoted  11 minutes ago
    RYCQLGAAAV  BJKETOESCA  promoted  27 minutes ag

Refresh your browser to see your change in action!

### A faster development loop

You may be thinking that this is shaping up to be a pretty nice workflow but it's a bit laborious for development. You can use `cx start` to pull an application into the foreground. `cx start` will restart the services of the application in development mode and set up live code-sync with your local development checkout allowing you to use your own tools and editor.

    $ cx start

Go ahead and delete the "Hello, this is a change!" line you added previously. You'll be able to immediately view the changes in your browser.

#### Code sync

Convox code sync allows changes you make in your local files to be instantly reflected in the containers running in your local rack. This lets you see the effect of changes without having to redeploy your appliction repeatedly.

Any directory that appears in a `COPY` or `ADD` line in your Dockerfile will be synced. This project has:

    COPY . .

in the Dockerfile, so the entire project directory is synced.

## Going to production

The local Rack is great for development, but eventually you'll also want to set up a production Rack on the internet where you can deploy your apps and make them accessible to others.

### Install a production Rack

#### AWS

An AWS Rack offers a highly scalable fault-tolerant environment built on modern AWS services such as ECS, ALB, and Lambda. 

The AWS Rack install process will use the `aws` CLI to execute the install. If you have not yet installed this tool visit the [AWS CLI Installation Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html).

To make sure this is working correctly run `aws configure`:

    $ aws configure
    AWS Access Key ID [****************W7GA]:
    AWS Secret Access Key [****************g0bb]:
    Default region name [us-east-1]:
    Default output format [json]:

Verify that the login and region info reflect where you want to install your Rack. Then use the `cx` tool to install your Rack.

    $ cx rack install aws
    CREATE_IN_PROGRESS    convox                        AWS::CloudFormation::Stack
    CREATE_IN_PROGRESS    RackCluster                   AWS::ECS::Cluster
    CREATE_IN_PROGRESS    RackCluster                   AWS::ECS::Cluster
    CREATE_IN_PROGRESS    Volumes                       AWS::EFS::FileSystem
    CREATE_IN_PROGRESS    RackRegistries                AWS::SDB::Domain
    CREATE_COMPLETE       RackCluster                   AWS::ECS::Cluster
    CREATE_IN_PROGRESS    Network                       AWS::CloudFormation::Stack
    CREATE_IN_PROGRESS    Volumes                       AWS::EFS::FileSystem
    CREATE_COMPLETE       convox                        AWS::CloudFormation::Stack
    . . .
    RACK_URL=https://...

The CloudFormation output will be streamed back to your terminal as the installation progresses. When the installation completes, a `RACK_URL` is returned.

**Make sure you note the value of `RACK_URL`. It is not recoverable.**

Export `RACK_URL` to your local environment to get `cx` talking to the AWS rack.

    $ export RACK_URL=https://715f4971060be34d64d9e2f39f33820d:@rack.convo-Balan-1EDQ1YOXSKZGL-1009186257.us-east-1.rack.convox.io

### Deploy to production

Now you can deploy your application to your production Rack. You've already verified everything on your development rack, so you can deploy with confidence.

    $ cx apps create praxis-site

    $ cx deploy

Remember that when the deployment completes you can find your service URLs with:

    $ cx services

Congratulations! You've just set up a powerful development workflow and deployed your application to robust cloud infrastructure!
